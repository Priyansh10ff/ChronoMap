🌍 ChronoMap - Time Travel Social Network
ChronoMap is a geospatial social network that lets users map their memories across time. It combines an interactive 3D-style map with a timeline slider, allowing you to "travel" through years and see memories pop up from the locations where they happened.

It features a "Spotify Wrapped" style recap, real-time social feeds, and an Instagram-like profile system with privacy controls.

✨ Features
📍 Time Travel Slider: Drag the slider to filter memories by year (2000–2030).

📸 Geotagging & Uploads: Drop a pin anywhere in the world and upload photos/videos.

🌍 Social Feed: Switch between "My Map" (Private) and "Explore" (Global Feed).

🔒 Privacy Controls: Create Public or Private profiles. Private memories are hidden from the global feed.

❤️ Likes & Interaction: Real-time like counts on memory pins.

🎁 Travel Wrapped: Generate a shareable "Instagram Story" style stats card of your journey.

🌑 Cyberpunk Mode: Custom dark-mode map styling with neon accents.
